Push the local codebase to the remote origin at git@github.com:toba/glean.git.

The remote is already configured but both local and remote have no commits. Need to make an initial commit and push.

## Steps
- [x] Verify remote is configured
- [x] Check remote state (empty)
- [x] Create initial commit with all files
- [x] Push to origin main


## Summary of Changes
Initial commit (2d270ee) pushed to origin/main with all 74 files (13,011 lines). Branch tracking configured.
