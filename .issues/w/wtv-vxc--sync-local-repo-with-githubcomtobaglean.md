Push the local codebase to the remote origin at git@github.com:toba/glean.git.

The remote is already configured but both local and remote have no commits. Need to make an initial commit and push.

## Steps
- [x] Verify remote is configured
- [x] Check remote state (empty)
- [ ] Create initial commit with all files
- [ ] Push to origin main
